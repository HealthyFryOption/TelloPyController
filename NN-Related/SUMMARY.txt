According to the current COV_NET5.py CNN architecture, handCapture directory should contain 6 gesture folders:

1) Palm
2) Fist
3) Peace
4) Right 
5) Left 
6) Thumbs Up

a) Use testModelTrack.py which connects to a webcam. Through hand tracking, press 'c' to take custom pictures of a gesture. View that file for more info. 
   NOTE: YOU CAN SKIP a) IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A DATASET READY

b) After collecting enough dataset images, run makeTrainingData.ipynb to create a .npy file containing the data of all images.

c) Run makeModel.ipynb to train model and save your trained model's parameters in a .pth file

d) run testModelTrack.py again to test the accuracy of gesture detection by pressing 't' instead of 'c' in real time. View that file for more info.
