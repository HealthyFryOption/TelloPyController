According to the current NeuralNet_DEEP CNN architecture, please add a folder named 'handCapture' in this directory, which subsequently should contain 6 gesture folders:

1) Palm
2) Fist
3) Peace
4) Right 
5) Left 
6) Thumbs Up

a) Use testModelTrack.py which connects to a webcam. Through hand tracking by pressing 'c', take custom pictures of a gesture. View that file for more info. 
   NOTE: YOU CAN SKIP a) IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A DATASET READY

b) After collecting enough dataset images, run makeTrainingData.ipynb to create a .npy file containing the data of all images.
c) Run makeModel.ipynb to train model and save your trained model's parameters in a .pth file
d) run testModelTrack.py to test the accuracy of gesture detection by pressing 't' in real time. View that file for more info. 

# model.log is to provide graph of accuracy and loss during training
